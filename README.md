MEGA_MATRIX
===========

A 3x3 matrix of 8x8 LED matrices 

 * You can find the firmware in `mm_arduino` (Arduino Uno's only).
 * You can find two applications to write images to MEGA_MATRIX in 'mm_py'
   * Use `png2mm.py` to create banners
   * Use `mm.py` to put those banners (or other animations) to MEGA_MATRIX
   * Be sure to read the headers of the source to know how to use them

If you want to put anything else other than scrolling banners up on MEGA_MATRIX
read the source of the applications to know how to write images.  From there,
have your own fun.
